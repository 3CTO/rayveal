# RayVeal
My own version of RevealJS. Based on the awesome [Reveal JS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Installation
Pretty much like installing RevealJS.

```sh
$ git clone this repository
$ npm install
```
The slide content is in the `slides` folder in markdown format. You can add as many markdown files as you want. There are custom styles for tables, code, etc.

When you're ready to preview the slides

```sh
$ grunt serve
```
